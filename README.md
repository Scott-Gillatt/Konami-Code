# Konami-Code
Reverse Engineer Konami example

Was shown an example of when the konami code was entered, that is when a function would then be excuted.

Was tasked to reverse engineer the example shown.  First attempt with watching users inputs based on their keyboard key strokes.  That when it then matched Konami code, that is when the alert message should be excuted.
